# Hi, Welcome!!ðŸ¤©
I am Yue Jiang. This is my portfolio page for the Telling Stories with Data in CMU. Hope you can enjoy it. 

# About me
Hello!! I am Carol, a master student in METALS. I am a current student in CMU HCII with the background of design and business. Three yearsâ€™ working experience as a consultant built me a strong sense of empathy to users/clients, communication skills to various stakeholders and the capability of quick learning. Interned in Baidu,  Chinaâ€™s Google, as well as TalkMeUp as an UX designer, I enjoyed creating my design within business considerations to build win-win solutions that make people smile and maximize companiesâ€™ business goals.Here is my personal portfolio page and you can click to learn me more: [Personal portfolio page](http://www.yuejiang.me)

# What I hope to learn
I want to learn data visualization in the course and plan to be a UX designer after graduation.

# Portfolio.
This ia a page to showcase what I learned. I learned different methods of data visualization and tried different websites. It is an intersting experience!
