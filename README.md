# Hi, Welcome!!🤩
I am Yue Jiang. This is my portfolio page for the Telling Stories with Data in CMU. Hope you can enjoy it. 

# About me 👧
Hello!! I am Carol, a master student in METALS. Three years’ working experience as a consultant built me a strong sense of empathy to users/clients, communication skills to various stakeholders and the capability of quick learning. Interned in Baidu,  China’s Google, as well as TalkMeUp as an UX designer, I enjoyed creating my design within business considerations to build win-win solutions that make people smile and maximize companies’ business goals.Here is my personal portfolio page and you can click to learn me more: [Personal portfolio page](http://www.yuejiang.me)

# What I hope to learn👧
Storytelling with data is a super interesting topic. My previous experience in consulting built me a strong sense of data analysis and logic thinking. I am interested to explore the relation between data and the stories behind the data. I want to learn basic rules/principles in data visualization and systematically build my data visualization skills. 

# Portfolio.🌐
This ia a page to showcase what I learned. I learned different methods of data visualization and tried different websites. It is an intersting experience!
