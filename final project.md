## Outline

### Why the topic?
With the brand value of 19 billions, Disney is one of the most profitable companies in the world and also bring hope and love to millions of people. As a big fan of Disney movies, I am really curious about what contributes to Disney's profits most and the most profitable character they created.

### Who is my audience?
Original thought: My audience is anyone who is interested in the topic. I will not set lines for the target audience.My audience is anyone who is interested in the topic. I could be business persons who are interested in the profitable of Disney, could be young students who love Disney... The topic is rather interesting and enjoyable. I believe that anyone who is interested in the topic can at least learn somethng from the data visualization and have some fun as well. 

Iterated thought: I still agree that the target audence should be those who are interested in the topic. However, I do think the audience should be someone who can at least read some business data and understand the logic that the princesses designed is one of the most important revenue resource for Disney. I am also trying to teach people view Disney princess from business perspective.

## Dataset
<p>I used two resources to finish the topic. Firstly, the revenue information comes from the open dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/prateekmaj21/disney-movies. I extracted movies related to Disney princess and calculate gross revenue per year according to the data. I would use the data to showcase ”how wealth these princess are" and " their capability in earning money". 
<p>The other one is the character analysis of these princesses:https://princess.disney.com/. I would utilize some color picker tool to match colors with their characteristics. 

## Interview protocol
<p>a. The target audience of my story is the fans of Disney and anyone who is interested in the topic. 
<p>b. I interviewed two of my friends who are extremely interested in Disney topics and also I interviewed one friend who is not that into the topic to see if my story can still interest him to some extent.

d. the findings from your interviews:
<p>1) The story is kind of detached from the question/topic. The comparison of revenue cannot reflect what is the wealthiest princess.
<p>2）More data visualization might needed to showcase the data. For example: how many years are each prince created and how does it influence the data.
<p>3)Need to show data/numbers on the diagram
<p>4）The diagrams are too coloful and should be emphasized with limited colors.
